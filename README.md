# Bash_WTF
21-line script in python that generates bash code which is capable of printing any message with JUST 4 letters!

### Usage

```python bashWTF.py [message]```

Just enter the message and then copy the code obtained, then paste it in a shell. For example, if I introduced a "Hello", the code obtained would be:
```
a() { /???/???/p????f ${@};}; o() { a ${#};}; a $(a "\\\\`o  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" ``o `"; a "\\\\`o  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" `"; a "\\\\`o  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  "" `"; a "\\\\`o  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  "" `"; a "\\\\`o  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" ``o  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  "" `"); 
```
